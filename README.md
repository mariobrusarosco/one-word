# One Word

A side project App where I intend to:

1. Simulate a real-world app as much as possible. The goal is to validate premises and get a
   closer feel for the pros and cons regarding front-end patterns, tools, and frameworks.

2. Use it as part of my _portfolio_ so I can demonstrate _some_ skills and somethings I learn on my spear time.
