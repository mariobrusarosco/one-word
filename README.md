# One Word

A side project App where I intend to:

1. Simulate a real world app, as much as possible. The goal is to validate premises and get a
   closer feeling about the pros anb cons regarding front end patterns, tools and frameworks.

2. Use it as part of my _portfolio_ so I can demonstrate _some_ skills and somethings I learn on my spear time.
