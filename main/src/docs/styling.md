# Main Approach

This side project aims to validate two things regarding styling for a Web Project:

- The usage of a Component Library as SHADCN UI
- Customizing Components generated by SHADCN UI

# Validation Goals

- [ ] #1 Effort to Create Components and customize them to _match completly different *DESIGN Guidelines*_ from _SHADCN's DESIGN_
- [ ] #2 Effort to maintain/refactor these Components when the _DESIGN Guidelines_ change.

# Learnings

## Dark/Light Mode

- We have a constraint: using 'dark:' and 'light:' prefixes for the classes.
- We can avoid this constraint setting 'class' globally, by using the @layer base directive.

```css
.bg-primary {
  @apply bg-primary-dark dark:bg-primary-light text-primary-foreground;
}

.text-primary {
  @apply dark:text-primary-light text-primary-dark;
}
```

## Validation #1

Effort to Create...

### Approach One

- High level of Customizaion!

By creating custom styles both on Tailwind and Components created by CHADCN UI:

#### First Effort

Create our tokens ans setting them in the tailwind.config.js file.

```js
export const ONE_WORD_PALETTE = {
  sun: {
    100: "#...",
    500: "#...",
    900: "#..."
  }
}

...
theme: {
   ...,
    extend: {
      colors: {
        ...ONE_WORD_PALETTE,
      },
    ...
```

#### Second Effort

Instead of using CHADCN UI generated classes, we can create our own classes. We create a custom color - sun - and set different levels... 100, 200...

We use the Tailwind prefixes in our advantage: bg-, text- and so on.

```tsx
const buttonVariants = cva(
  "shadow-main-bottom bg-sun-100 text-sun-900...",
  ...
```

### Approach Two

Keep CHADCN UI generated classes, but modify the styles for those classes on our tailwing config.

CHADCN UI classes like bg-primary, text-primary, shadow-primary-bottom, etc.

```tsx
const buttonVariants = cva(
  "bg-primary text-primary shadow-primary-bottom",
  ...
```

On App's main CSS file, the one responsible for the global styles...\*:

```css
@layer base {
  .bg-primary {
    @apply bg-sun-100 dark:bg-sun-900;
  }

  .text-primary {
    @apply bg-sun-400 dark:bg-sun-800;
  }
}
```

## Pros

## Cons

## Summary

# Development FAQ

## Create a Component via CLI

```shell
npx shadcn-ui@latest init # If it's the first time!

npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component]
```
