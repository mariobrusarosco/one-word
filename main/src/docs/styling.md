# Main Approach

This side project aims to validate two things regarding styling for a Web Project:

- The usage of a Component Library as SHADCN UI
- Customizing Components generated by SHADCN UI

# Validation Goals

- [ ] Effort to Create Components and customize them to _match completly different *DESIGN Guidelines*_ from _SHADCN's DESIGN_
- [ ] Effort to maintain/refactor these Components when the _DESIGN Guidelines_ change.

# Learnings

## Dark/Light Mode

- We have a constraint: using 'dark:' and 'light:' prefixes for the classes.
- We can avoid this constraint setting 'class' globally, by using the @layer base directive.

```css
.bg-primary {
  @apply bg-primary-dark dark:bg-primary-light text-primary-foreground;
}

.text-primary {
  @apply dark:text-primary-light text-primary-dark;
}
```

# Development FAQ

## Create a Component via CLI

```shell
npx shadcn-ui@latest init # If it's the first time!

npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component]
```
